# womens_safety_app
My Women's Safety App("HERSHIELD ") is designed to help users stay safe by enabling real-time location sharing and an emergency SOS button. With features like “Follow Me” mode, users can share their live location while traveling. The app uses Firebase for authentication and data storage, and Google Maps for navigation.
